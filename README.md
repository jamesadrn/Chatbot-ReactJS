# 🧑‍💻 ReactJS Chatbot (Learning Project)

A simple chatbot built with **ReactJS** as part of my learning journey.  
This project started from a [SuperSimpleDev ReactJS tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/c/SuperSimpleDev) and then I **modified and improved** it with additional features and custom design.  

---

## ✨ Features
- React components with **state & props**.
- Auto-scroll to the latest message using **useEffect + ref**.
- Simple chatbot response powered by external library.
- **Custom UI design** with styled chat bubbles and avatars.
- New improvements I added:
  - 🌓 Dark/Light mode toggle.
